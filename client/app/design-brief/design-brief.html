    In this project two different visualization were made with an approach of
    showing both an aesthetic overview and one showing more detailed analysis.
  </p>
  <p style="color: white">
    The aesthetic overview is supposed to provide an understanding of how people interact with the page (video view, photo view, link links etc.). According to Pousman and Stasko (2006)
    ambient information displays are meant to be aesthetically pleasing and environmentally appropriate.

    Therefore, a smooth steam graph was placed on a black background representing interactions with the Facebook page over time. This to show a beautiful abstraction relevant for the people
    coming to the studio, and to work as an artistic artifact showing on the wall. The choice of black background was to improve the visual experience looking in the context of the VIC studio.
    On top of that, a brushing tool is used to zoom the artistic data visualization and makes it manageable. Furthermore, the user gets details on demand by hovering the different categories.
  </p>
  <p style="color: white">
    However, real time dynamic updates of data would probably increase the notification level to make the people visiting aware of the visualization (Pousman and Stasko, 2006). For example, the
    visualisation <i>Precence Era</i> is showing that (Viegas et al., 2004).

  <p style="color: white">
    For the more detailed analysis parallel coordinates where chosen to give the ability for more executive summaries of published posts. With parallel coordinates different dimensions can be
    compared to find interesting posts.
