  <h1 style="color: white">User study</h1>
<!--  <p style="color: white">
    In this project two different visualization were made with an approach of
    showing both an aesthetic overview and one showing more detailed analysis.
  </p>
  <p style="color: white">
    The aesthetic overview is supposed to provide an understanding of how people interact with the page (video view, photo view, link links etc.). According to Pousman and Stasko (2006)
    ambient information displays are meant to be aesthetically pleasing and environmentally appropriate.
  </p>
  <p style="color: white">
    Therefore, a smooth steam graph was placed on a black background representing interactions with the Facebook page over time. This to show a beautiful abstraction relevant for the people
    coming to the studio, and to work as an artistic artifact showing on the wall. The choice of black background was to improve the visual experience looking in the context of the VIC studio.
    On top of that, a brushing tool is used to zoom the artistic data visualization and makes it manageable. Furthermore, the user gets details on demand by hovering the different categories.
  </p>
  <p style="color: white">
    However, real time dynamic updates of data would probably increase the notification level to make the people visiting aware of the visualization (Pousman and Stasko, 2006). For example, the
    visualisation <i>Precence Era</i> is showing that (Viegas et al., 2004).

    For the more detailed analysis parallel coordinates where chosen to give the ability for more executive summaries of published posts. With parallel coordinates different dimensions can be
    compared to find interesting posts.

        1) Would like to see more of the graph, because when opening it on the Macbook Pro laptop you cannot see the whole brushing tool.
        Feels like it's only a reflection of the graph rather than a brushing tool (see Image 1). <br><br>
        <u><b>Solution:</b></u> Changed the footer to not have fixed position, as the brushing tool then was hided on smaller screens.
      </p>
      <p style="color: white">
        2) Difficult to understand what the different colors represent in the graph. Especially, because the info text showing up in the left corner is quite small and just shows quickly.<br><br>
        <u><b>Solution:</b></u> Added more explaining data in the info box at the left top
      </p>
      <p style="color: white">
         3) Cannot understand the meaning of the number zero in the graph. It feels like it should be 4500 according to the user, as the graph is generated in the middle of the viewport, which makes it confusing (see Image 2).
      </p>
      <p style="color: white">
        4) One user tried to interact with the main graph initially (but nothing happened), and said it was difficult to see how to use the controller below the graph.
      </p>
      <p style="color: white">
        5) Finally, it was difficult to see when you switched between different days (by moving the mouse horizontally). Therefore, one suggestion was to show the interaction steps that was possible to make.<br><br>
        <u><b>Solution:</b></u> Added a thin vertical line that followed the mouse when it hovered the graph.

        Also (this for a user without any previous experience of parallel coordinates), the instructions of how to interact with the visual structure was difficult to grasp.
        The lines in the graph was hard to relate to any data, which was as a response to the question of what the lines represented. The first impression when interacting with the graph (brushing) was that a
        lot of data showed in the table below.
